DESCRIPTION
-----------
This mimics the Drupal 7 core simpletest module. The same format may be used in
this module as in the core Drupal 7 version. Please use any documenation for
the Drupal 7 version.

ISSUES
------
Any issues may be posted to the SimpleTest issue queue
(http://drupal.org/project/issues/simpletest), but if they are feature requests
or effect both the core version and the 6.x version then the issue will be
moved into the core and committed there first.
