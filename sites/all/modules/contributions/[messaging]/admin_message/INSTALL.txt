INSTALLATION
------------
1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE (if something goes wrong)

2. INSTALL ADMIN MESSAGE
   
   Unpack the module in your sites module directory. Then browse to 
   "Administer" -> "Site building" -> "Modules" and enable the module.
   
3. CONFIGURE ADMIN MESSAGE

   The module provides the block "Admin messages" where the messages are listed 
   and can be closed by the users. Enable it at "Administer" -> 
   "Site building" -> "Blocks". You probably want to hide the block for
   anonymous users: configure the block and check "authenticated user" at
   "Show block for specific roles".
   
   You will also have to grant the "close admin messages" permission to roles
   you would like to be able to close your admin messages.
   
4. CREATE A MESSAGE
    
   Go to "Create content" -> "Admin message" and enter a message.
   Optionally set "Message visibility" options. It should show up in the
   block when saved.
   
   NOTE: There is no access control included, just the standard access provided 
   by Drupal, which means that all users with "access content" permission can 
   view messages. So don't provide any sensitive information.

 5. THEMING
 
   Admin messages are themed via a single theme fuction. Copy this function to
   your theme's template.php, replace 'theme' with your theme's name, and configure
   as needed.
   
   /*
    * Theme the admin message's output
    * 
    * @param $node
    *   The entire admin message node object
    * @param $close_link
    *   A boolean value of whether or not user has access to close the message
    * @return
    *   The themed output for display within the admin message block
    */
   function theme_admin_message_message($node, $close_link) {
     $output  = '<div class="admin-message sticky">';
     if($close_link) {
       // Changing the class on the link will make the javascript no longer function.
       $output .= l(t('Close'), 'admin_message/close/'. $node->nid, array('attributes'=>array('class' => 'admin-message-close', 'title' => t('Close this message'))));
     }
     $output .= node_view($node);
     $output .= '</div>';
     return $output;
   }
