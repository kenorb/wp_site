3. Disable the lm_paypal* modules in admin/modules
4. Drop the lm_paypal* tables from your database and delete the entry for

If you used a previous version of this module (1.6 or above) then after
installing this version (see INSTALL.txt) you will need to upgrade the
modules. Follow the link to update.php at the top of administer/modules.

You will also have to reset your access permissions in administer/access control
as some of the permission names have changed.

If you used 1.17 or below after upgrading please disable all the lm_paypal
modules and then re-enable them. This is to avoid the hook_init() problem
reported by one user.
