// $Id: CHANGELOG.txt,v 1.1.2.11.2.35 2009/01/30 20:45:46 jareyero Exp $

TO DO
------
* Add CAN-SPAM complicance, 'Unsubscribe from all'..
* Use actions and triggers instead of old notifications' events, see http://drupal.org/node/260100
* Streamline the UI. Replace the user account tabs with a single page using collapsible fieldsets providing some more global options for each type (method, interval for each subscription type)
* Move some left parts of the UI provided by modules into the notifications_ui module so we can have a drop-in replacement to provide a yet more simple UI.
* Support for persistent notifications that will be triggered with a given interval until the user takes some action. Look into the subscription system to see whether this is currently possible with a plug-in or we need some api extensions.
* Support for notifications in multiple languages, depending on user language
