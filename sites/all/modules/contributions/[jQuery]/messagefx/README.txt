The Message Effects module adds attention getting JavaScript effects to Drupal messages.
It depends on the Colorpicker module and the JQuery UI module which in turn relies on the JQuery Update module.

Administrators can choose between various effects selectable for status or error messages. The current list is:

- Pulsate - flash in and out
- Highlight - add a highlight background color to element and fade it away
- Shake - shake the element horizontally a number of times
- Bounce - bounce the element vertically into place
- Fade In - fade in the element at the specified speed
- Growl - raises unobtrusive messages within the browser, similar to OS X's Growl Framework
- None - do nothing
