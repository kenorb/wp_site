jQuery Impromptu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jQuery Impromptu is an extension to help provide a more pleasant way to
spontaneously prompt a user for input. More or less this is a great replacement
for an alert, prompt, and confirm. Not only does it replace these but it also
allows for creating forms within these controls. This is not intended to be a
modal replacement, just a quick tool to prompt user input in a fashionable way.

This module simply places jQuery Impromptu in a central location with one
command that can be called from any module that wants to use the library.

A module should simply call:

  jquery_impromptu_add()

The module takes no arguments and returns no value, but it will include the
javascript in the page header.


Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JQuery Impromptu library is released under the Apache 2.0 License, which is
GNU/GPL version 3 compatible, but not version 2 compatible.  So, it must be
downloaded separately from the author's website:

Save the library in the jquery_impromptu folder as jquery_impromptu.js.
