          reorganized the code for better extensibility.

          case it is not.
- #90272: Implemented JSON output and added a setting for specifying whether
          to use JSON or XML for loading the timeline data feed.

- #90272: Implemented a best-effort workaround for the widget's timezone
          display bugs, claiming dates are GMT while they're in fact
          explicitly adjusted to the current user's timezone.

          timeline XHTML element ID to the name of the current timeline view
