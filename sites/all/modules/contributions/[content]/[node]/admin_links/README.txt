This is a very simple module that adds useful edit and delete shortcuts to
lists of nodes. It also makes the 'Delete' link show up as a tab in the
individual node view just like the 'Edit' and 'View' tabs (Drupal 6+ only).

This module also provides support for the Universal Edit Button, a green pencil
icon in the address bar that indicates a web page is editable. It is similar to
the orange "broadcast" RSS icon that indicates there is an RSS feed available.
For more information and to download the Universal Edit Button browser
extension, visit http://universaleditbutton.org/.
