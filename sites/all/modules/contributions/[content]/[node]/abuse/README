Abuse Module:

Permissions: There are now 3 permissions - administer abuse reports,
flag content, and direct flag content.  Administer abuse reports allows
a user to see which nodes have been flagged and allows them to either
remove from the site or allow back into the system.  Flag content allows
a user to flag content.  Direct flag allows a user to flag a content and
set the content as 'hidden'.  In essence, it is a person who has been
trusted to flag genuinely bad content to be removed without requiring
multiple users to flag the content before the system hides it.

Node status:
The abuse system holds 4 primary status: Allow, Pending, Hidden, and
Remove.  Items that were flagged into the system but allowed back are
given an allow status (the module allows to keep a log on items that had
been entered).  Pending items are items that were flagged and require
reviewing (and are still viewable on the site).  Hidden items are items
that were flagged multiple times and as such are hidden from other users
until a user with administer abuse reports permissions checks it out. And 
removed items are items reviewed by a user with administer abuse reports and
deemed it necessary to remove from the site.

About flagging a node:
This system has changed.  Users must now provide a reason why the
content was flagged.  Moreover, they must provide their name and email
address (if they are anonymous; registered users have this logged) so
the administrator/moderator would have an idea on who wrote it.

The abuse section has the 3 primary sections (Pending, Hidden, Removed)
available as tabs to browse between the different sections.

Other features:
Flag comments
Warn user on content by sending email
Automatically flag content based on a regular expression wordlist (SEE watchlist module)

MAJOR TODO:
Figure out paging
