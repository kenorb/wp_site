the module.

      
SUMMARY 
-------
The Dynamic display block module enables you to create blocks to present content 
in a dynamic way. For creating slideshow effects it uses the jQuery Cycle plug-in.

There are three ways to specify content for the Dynamic display block module:

* A folder containing image files
* A node from a content type with multiple input
* An instance of any created block

The headerimage module or CCK and Views makes retrieving and displaying content with 
the Dynamic display block module very flexible.

Several effects and other setting can be set in the configuration settings of the
Dynamic display block module.
