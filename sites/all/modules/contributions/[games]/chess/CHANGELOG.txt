* by MGN: Added new Drupal 6 branch of chess module

The database is not updating the 'chess_info' table... not sure why... ARGH! Must be because of the addition of the new variables for check and checkmate... try not updating those perhaps?

* Changed the row numbers to be right... that was a stupid mistake!

* Changed the default directory where chess pieces are found
* Included the chess pieces in the download, and placed them in the default directory
* Added a second block option, that displays (in notation form) the previous moves
* Added a new setting (at /admin/settings/chess) to configure the number of previous moves to display
* Moves can be undone
	* When moves are undone, 'check' and 'checkmate' are always unset.
	* If there are no moves to undo (i.e. no moves have been made), then the undo button is not shown.
