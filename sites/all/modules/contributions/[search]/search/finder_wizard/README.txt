2. At admin/build/modules enable the Filter Wizard module.
3. Enable permissions at admin/user/permissions.
4. Configure the module at admin/build/filter_wizard.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Once the module is activated, you can create your question and answer pairs by
creating FAQ nodes (Create content >> FAQ).  This allows you to edit the
question and answer text.  In addition, if the 'Taxonomy' module is enabled and
there are some terms configured for the FAQ node type, it will also be possible
to put the questions into different categories when editing.
