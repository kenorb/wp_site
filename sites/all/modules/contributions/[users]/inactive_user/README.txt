Overview:
--------
The inactive_user module provides Drupal administrators with an automatic
way to manage inactive user accounts.  This module has two goals:  to help
keep users coming back to your site by reminding them when they've been away
for a configurable period of time, and to cleanup unused accounts.

One or more of the following actions can be automatically taken for users that
have exceeded configurable periods of inactivity:
  - send an email to the user
  - send an email to the site administrator
  - block the account (a warning can first be issued, and notification can
     be sent to the user and/or site administrator when the action occurs)
  - delete the account (a warning can first be issued, and notification can
     be sent to the user and/or site administrator when the action occurs)
  - optionally prevent deletion of user that have created site content

All events triggered by this module are logged via the watchdog.
