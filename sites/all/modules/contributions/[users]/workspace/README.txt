Drupal: 6

DESCRIPTION:

This is a module designed for users to have a central place to
view and manage their content.

Thanks to Matt Westgate for his hand-holding during the creation
of this, my first Drupal module.

********************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

1. Place the entire workspace directory into the sites/all/modules
   directory of your Drupal installation.

2. Enable the workspace module by navigating to:

     Administer > Site building > Modules

   When enabled, a "My workspace" menu should appear in the menu 
   system.
   
3. Under Administer > User management > Permissions you may wish
   to give users the ability to configure their own workspace.
