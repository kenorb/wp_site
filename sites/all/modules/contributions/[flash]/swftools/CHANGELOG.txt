---------------
Appending the nocache string to filenames seems to have broken content, but
I'm sure it was working before. Recommitting without the cache setting until
I can be sure it is working right.

03 October 2008
---------------
#314045 - Constants incorrectly defined - fixed.

23 September 2008
-----------------
Cumulative changes that address a number of issues.
Identification of default players on the admin screen was wrong.
swftools_get_media_url changed due to bug that resulted in double /
appearing in the file path (#308172).
Auto-detection of sizes changed so that players are always auto
detected even when a remote media url is configured.
Test content added to status page to help identify if SWF Tools is
working.
Missing php from <?php in swftools.admin.status.inc

6 September 2008
----------------
First official release of SWF Tools for Drupal 6!

Text below describes what was changed as part of this release compared to v5.

swftools.module
---------------
Menus updated to v6
Use of l() in filter fixed
Settings call backs updated
File checks in swf() modified to better handle local files(?)
_swftools_tf logic modified - was returning wrong values
allowfullscreen parameter added to _swftools_params and embedding generation routine
Text changed to sentence case for consistency with rest of Drupal
Assigning action in swf() occurred twice - one instance deleted
$nocache logic changed so caching string only appended once at the very end (not sure how this works)
swftools_get_media_url changed to use file_create_url - should allow private file system
Suggested fix for encoding in _swftools_get_flashvars_string applied
swftools_theme() added to allow theme function to be registered
Code that attempts to generate a valid base path altered to make a better guess
Base path made compatible with private file system
Fixes as per issue list at end of this document
Parameter list extended to better support macros
SWF Filter changed to be easier to use with other filters (<swf > is replaced
by [swf ] during the prepare phase, so the code isn't stripped by HTML filters.
[swf ] can be used directly when writing a filter. Filters can now be written
using just [swf file=""] or [swf files=""] and filter will use file/files to
determine if a playlist is intended. [swflist ] can still be used so old filter
entries will work as originally planned.
Filter amended to strip <p></p> from around the filter, to allow W3C validation
to pass.
Direct embedding mark-up changed to be standards compliant.
swf() function parameters altered - now works more like the rest of Drupal 6 as
an array of parameters is passed, rather than a series of parameters - pass an
array with (optional) keys params, flashvars, othervars, methods. Params are
passed to the generation code, flashvars becomes the flashvars string,
othervars and method are passed to SWF Tools handlers.
Check for existence of playlist directory (and creation as required) added to
swftools_get_playlist_path() so it is created without having to visit settings
page.
Constant SWFTOOLS_INSTALLED added to make it easier to notify other modules if
SWF Tools is available.
Adding js to every page now defaults to TRUE (and SWFTOOLS_ALWAYS_ADD_JS added
as a constant for code legibility). This means that SWF Tools behaves as
"expected" with filters, without users having to specifically set this option.
More descriptive messages when no player is configured, so users are directed
to the appropriate settings page.
Various drupal_set_messages made translate by use of t() function.
Wording of settings pages changed to make more consistent with rest of Drupal.
When playing media file_url is added to othervars['file_url'] so that player
modules can access the media file path if they need to. This is particularly
required for FlowPlayer to allow the appropriate config string to be built.
swftools_push_js() added to hook_init(), rather than hook_menu() since it is
technically not a menu function!
New code added to direct embedding to assign an object id to the outer (IE6)
object - without this JW Media Player 4 with IE6 causes pages to say they have
an error.


swftools.admin.inc
------------------
Form creation code adjusted to suit v6 menu call back
Allow full screen parameter added to embed form
Missing files now generate a download link if the download key is set in the
methods array.
Settings page altered slightly to put all file handling options together (some
were under embedding settings). Means embedding settings is now simple for new
users.
Settings moved to sit under Administer > Site configuration > SWF Tools rather
than promoting SWF Tools to a top level below Administer.
Option added to file handling to allow SWF Tools to respond to requests to
access swf, jpg, jpeg, mp3, flv and xml under a private file system.
Cache flushing now calls drupal_flush_all_caches() which clears filters, block
and page caches, so is more likely to ensure changes to flash content are
properly rendered later.


swftools.admin.status.inc
-------------------------
Added a status page that generates reports much like the system status report.
Intent is to provide some diagnostics if an installation isn't working.
At the moment it can report on whether the embedding and playback features
appear to be correctly configured (methods are available, supporting files are
available etc)
Status report is found at admin/reports/swftools.


genericplayers.module
---------------------
Menu updated to v6
Option to disable autoplay flv disabled as generic player always autoplays.


swfobject.info
--------------
Modified to v6


swftools.info
-------------
Modified to v6


swfobject.module
----------------
Added a download key to swfobject_swftools_methods() so the admin form can
provide a link to the required files


onepixelout.module
---------------
Menu updated to v6
Added a download key to onepixelout_swftools_methods() so the admin form
can provide a link to the required files
_swf() and _swflist() functions removed as redundant


wijering.info
-------------
Name string renamed JW Media Player 3 to make explicit to version 4 module.
Description string changed to make explicit this is for JW Player 3.


wijering.module
---------------
Menu updated to v6
Added a download key to wijering_swftools_methods() so the admin form can
provide a link to the required files
_swf() and _swflist() functions removed as redundant


wijering.admin.inc
------------------
wijering_admin_form_submit updated to forms API v6
Form routine tweaked to make it look more like a regular system settings form,
ie Reset to default option added to admin form
Confirmation message added to simulate settings form


wijering4.module / wijering4.admin.inc / wijering4.info
-------------------------------------------------------
Initial version of a module to support Wijering media player 4.
Some of the parameters have been renamed, some are gone, and some new ones
have been implemented.


imagerotator.module / imagerotator.admin.in / imagerotator.info
---------------------------------------------------------------
Image rotator separated out from JW Media Player 3 - logically this is a
different module to the main player module, so it seems sensible to
have this as a separate package. To the end user it makes a logical
distinction between media players and the image cycler. Also, the JW
Image Rotator is still at version 3, so to have Media Player 4 and
Image Rotator 3 would mean enabling Media Player 3 which is counter
intuitive! Internally it still uses the name WIJERING_IMAGEROTATOR
so the existing variables are preserved, even though this is now a
distinct module.


lutman.module
-------------
Added download key to methods array to allow easy download.


lutman.info
-----------
Updated to v6
Is descriptor right? It says lutman is included, but it isn't?


ufo.module
-------------
Added download key to methods array to allow easy download.
Removed alert pop-ups.


ufo.info
-----------
Updated to v6


simpleviewer.module
-------------------
Menu updated to v6.


swfobject2.module / swfobject2.info
-----------------------------------
Support for SWF Object 2 added, and output made standards compliant.
Uses the flashvars in array format, rather than string form, to provide
clearer javascript, and seems to be working ok.
Original version of this module added the js to the page header, but
that causes content generated with filters to break!
js now added to page body, rather than header - remembered that when filter
caching is enabled the js won't get added to the page header!
New code added to assign unique id to the object (using swf followed by the
same id numbers as the div. Without this JW Media Player 4 with IE6 causes
pages to say they have an error.


flowplayer.module / flowplayer.info / flowplayer.admin.inc
----------------------------------------------------------
Feature request under SWF Tools 5.1 asked for support for FlowPlayer.
This module introduces initial support, but more work needed at the
moment. Adding this module resulted in the changes to swfobject2 to
use the array format, and the addition of the media file path to
the resolved_methods array in SWF Tools itself.


Private file handling
---------------------
Change to method of generating path seems to allow private files to work.
Tested with playback of a swf, and also an mp3 via generic and Wijering players.
If files are placed on the site via FTP then a SWF Tools option must be set
on the File handling page to allow SWF Tools to grant access to media files.
It allows access to swf, mp3, flv, xml, jpg, jpeg and png formats. If access is
denied by any other module then access is not allowed, so content that is
being protected by a module is not compromised by activating this setting.
The default setting for allowing access to private files is OFF, so to let
SWF Tools allow handling of private files it must be explicitly set by the
user on the settings page (Administer > Site configuration > SWF Tools >
File handling > Private file system).


General
-------
Broken identifier strings replaced with correct format
UFO and SWFObject 1.5 are both superceded by SWFObject 2.0 - new module written
but not tested extensively yet.
Configuration pages moved to sit under Administer > Site configuration > SWF
Tools, rather than having SWF Tools promoted to its own level.
Default HTML alt added as a constant for clarity, and wording made a little
more informative to assist users who don't see the content.
File locations settings moved from embedding page to file handling page. This
is more consistent, and presents new users with fewer options on the first
settings page. Most people probably never change anything other than the
embedding method at first.


Issue queue
-----------
218326 - Full screen does not work
166804 - Fullscreen option for JW PLAYER
153780 - Full Screen Support using Wijering Flash
Full screen now a parameter on the settings page, and passed to flash modules
to enable it.

191279 - Strange escaping behaviour of ":" and "/" and 1 pixel out Player
173021 - 1PixelOut - Error Opening File
154364 - input formats!
202591 - 1pixelout can't find file
Incorporated the suggested fix to reverse the encoding.
This probably explains "203301 - Error Opening File" as well.

178283 - Patch to fix bug in "base" parameter for direct embedding
Patch applied - base now properly set when using direct embedding mode.

179322 - variable_get for Flash Version incorrect
Suggested fix applied.
scale and swliveconnect had similar errors so fixed those too.

146935 - Menu titles get strange formatting because of surplus white space
Fixed

157397 - file path for attachment is wrong
Think this is fixed with modified file handling mechanism that was needed as
the "double files" issue occurred with flash node too.

252956 - Private Uploads and SWFTools
Should be fixed with new code that allows used of private file systems with
SWF Tools. Note - SWF Tools must be allowed to grant access to playlists.

294163 - Standards Compliant Flash
SWF Tools now produces standards complaint (XHTML 1.0 Strict) using either
direct embedding or via SWF Object 2 *in most cases*. The filter component
has been updated to string the <p></p> that wrap around the <div> containing
the flash, but if you use the format in the middle of a paragraph this won't
work properly and you will get code that FAILS validation. If validation is
important then you may need to test pages containing to SWF Tools content to
verify that they are validating properly.

181473 - FlowPlayer support
FlowPlayer support has been added.

233375 - Upgrade to 6.0
Here it is!

186896 - Wijering player w/playlist shows up on IE, not on FF or Opera
Have not been able to recreate this error, but seems to be ok under all tests
during develop of SWF Tools 6, so assuming can be closed.
