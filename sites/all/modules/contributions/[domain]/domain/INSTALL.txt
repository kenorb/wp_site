----
1.  Introduction

The Domain Access module is a Node Access module.  It is designed to
restrict access to content.

Failure to install or uninstall this module according to instructions may
cause errors in your site.

----
2.  Installation

This module requires some advanced understanding of Drupal and of
how DNS servers behave.  If you simply untar the download and
activate the module, it may not work correctly.

When you enable the module, it will create a {domain} table in your Drupal
database.

All existing nodes on your site will be assigned to the default domain for your
web site and to all affiliates.  If you wish to alter this behavior, see sections
2.4 through 2.6 of README.txt

----
2.1  Before Installing

You will need to do the following before you install the module.

  - Read this document
  - Configure your web server DNS records appropriately
  - Read the supplied README.txt
  - Install and configure Drupal normally.

WARNING: The Domain Access module series instructs you to add a
file include to your settings.php file.  Do not add this command until
after you have installed Drupal.

----
2.2   Server Configuration

For the module to work correctly, the DNS record of your server must accept
multiple DNS entries pointing at a single IP address that hosts your Drupal
installation.

The two basic methods for doing this are either to:

  - Setup WildCard DNS, so that *.example.com resolves to your Drupal site.
  - Setup VirtualHosts so that one.example.com, two.example.com, etc. all
    resolve to your Drupal site.

For example, on my local testing machine, I have VirtualHosts to the following
sites setup in httpd.conf (and my hosts file, to allow the .test TLD):

  - ken.test => 127.0.0.1
  - one.ken.test => 127.0.0.1
  - two.ken.test => 127.0.0.1
  - three.ken.test => 127.0.0.1

It is beyond the scope of this document to explain how to configure your DNS
server.  For more information, see:

  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting

After you have enabled multiple DNS entries to resolve to your Drupal
installation, you may activate the module and configure its settings.

NOTE: No matter how many domains resolve to the same IP, you only need one instance
of Drupal's settings.php file.  The sites folder should be named 'default' or
named for your primary domain.

----
2.3 Setting DOMAIN_INSTALL_RULE

This is an advanced instruction, and may be ignored.

At the top of the domain.module file, you will find this line:

  define('DOMAIN_INSTALL_RULE', TRUE);

This setting controls the default behavior of the module when installing over
an existing installation.  If set to TRUE, the Domain Access module will assign
all existing nodes to be viewable by your primary domain.

If you set this value to FALSE, existing content will not be visible on your
primary domain unless DOMAIN_SITE_GRANT is set to TRUE.

For more details, see section 5 of README.txt.

----
2.4 Setting DOMAIN_SITE_GRANT

At the top of the domain.module file, you will find this line:

  define('DOMAIN_SITE_GRANT', TRUE);

This setting controls the default behavior for viewing affiliate content.
By design, the Domain Access module allows site administrators to assign
content to 'all affiliates.'  If this value is set to TRUE, then content
assigned to all affiliates can be seen by all users on all current domains.

On install, setting this value to TRUE will assign all current content to
be viewable on all domains.

Normally, you will not need to edit this value.

----
3.   Installing the Module

After you have prepared your server and made any edits to the
default module behavior, you may install Domain Access like any
other Drupal module.

----
3.1   After Installation

Note that as of 6.x.2.0, the primary domain is created for you on 
installation.

The primary domain will use the SERVER_NAME value of the request made
when installing the module. This value may be edited by going to
Admin > Build > Domains and editing the Primary Domain value.

After you install the module, you should visit Admin > Users > Permissions
and set the module permissions; normally you will give your site 
administrators the following permissions:

    -- 'administer domains'
    -- 'set domain access'

After saving permissions, go to Admin > Build > Domains and configure
your site's Primary Domain.

For more information, see README.txt.

----
4. Patch to Drupal Core (optional)

The following patch is optional.  The patch affects advanced behavior of the
Domain Access module.

The patch is distributed in the 'patches' folder of the download.

To apply this patch, place it in your root Drupal folder.
Then follow the instructions at: http://drupal.org/patch/apply

----
4.1 multiple_node_access.patch

You should apply this patch only if you use Domain Access along with
another Node Access module, such as Organic Groups (OG).

The multiple_node_access.patch allows Drupal to run more than one
node access control scheme in parallel.  Instead of using OR logic to
determine node access, this patch uses subselects to enable AND logic
for multiple node access rules.

Developers: see http://drupal.org/node/191375 for more information.

This patch has being submitted to Drupal core for version 7.

----
5.  Configuring settings.php

Remember, the Domain Access module lets you run multiple sites
from a single installation.  You only need one settings.php file.

As a result, some options in your settings.php file need to be
considered carefully.

----
5.1   $base_url

The $base_url setting is normally not set.  With Domain Access, you
cannot set this value manually.

Since mutliple domains are involved, Drupal needs to be allowed to
set this value.  (For the technical, this happens in the conf_init()
function).

----
5.2   $db_prefix

The $db_prefix value allows for table prefixing of your Drupal database
in the event that you run more than one site from a single database.

$db_prefix can be used normally with Domain Access.

However, the Domain Prefix module provides for dynamic table prefixing
based on the currently active domain.  If you use the Domain Prefix module
you can only set $db_prefix as a string value, not an array.

For more detail, see INSTALL.txt in the domain_prefix folder.

----
5.3   $cookie_domain

By design, Drupal cookies are set for the current website on login.  That is, if
you login from www.example.com, the cookie will be set from the domain
'www.example.com.'

However, a cookie from www.example.com is not valid on one.example.com.

In order to provide for login across your active domains, you must set the
$cookie_domain value to the string indicating your root domain.

Typically, this value is '.example.com'.

If your domains do not share the top-level, then you may need to login to
each site separately or use a module such as Single SignOn.

NOTE: After you change your cookie value, you will need to logout and
log back in for the new cookie to take effect.

----
5.4  Add settings.inc

For Domain Access to work, you must add some code to your settings.php
file. This code will load the Domain Access bootstrap routines that determine
how your site is being requested. 

If you do not add settings.inc to your settings.php file, Domain Access will
fail to load and report an error message to site administrators.

IMPORTANT: You must add these lines to settings.php after the $db_url
has been set; otherwise, Drupal will fail to load. Normally, you should add
these lines to the end of the settings.php file.

----
5.4.1  Installation

In the Domain Access download, find the following file:

  domain > settings.inc

You will need to load this file from inside your settings.php file. There
are two methods for this.

----
5.4.2  Option 1 -- Preferred

This method is preferred, since any updates to the module release
will be reflected in this file.

NOTE: the elements inside the ==== marks are php code that
should be copied into your settings.php file.  DO NOT COPY THE ==== MARKS.

Add the following lines to the end of your settings.php file:

====
/**
 * Add the domain module setup routine.
 */
include './path/to/modules/domain/settings.inc';
====

In this case, change 'path/to/modules' with the directory where your modules are
stored.  Typically this will be 'sites/all/modules', which makes the lines:

====
/**
 * Add the domain module setup routine.
 */
include './sites/all/modules/domain/settings.inc';
====

----
5.4.3 Option 2

If you are having difficulty determining the correct path, copy the following files
into your settings folder.

  domain > domain.bootstrap.inc
  domain > settings.inc
  domain > settings_custom_url.inc

The files should be in the same directory as your active settings.php file.  Then
add the following lines:

====
/**
 * Add the custom_url_rewrite_outbound function.
 */
include 'settings.inc';
====

----
5.4.4   Testing Your Configuration

After editing your settings.php file, go to Admin > Build > Domains.  You may
see a warning at the top of the page:

  "Domain access failed to load during phase: -1. Please check your settings.php 
  file and site configuration."

This message means that your PHP server cannot find the include file.  You
may need to test other path options for the include code.

----
5.4.5   Additional Resources

If you are having trouble configuring the include, you should check your
PHP include path.  You may need to use an absolute path to your server root.

  http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path

You may also copy the entire function custom_url_rewrite_outbound() directly
into your settings.php file.

----
5.5 custom_url_rewrite_outbound()

Domain Access implements this function inside its settings.inc file.
Domain Access has not been tested with other uses of 
custom_url_rewrite_outbound().

If your site currently implements this function, you will need to make custom
edits to your current file.  Either move the function from domain/settings.inc
into your current function, or vice versa.

For more information, see
  http://api.drupal.org/api/function/custom_url_rewrite_outbound/6

----
6.  Additional Module Installation

The Domain Access module includes several sub-modules.  Two of these
have their own INSTALL.txt instructions.

----
6.1   Domain Strict

While this module requires no additional installation, it fundamentally
changes the behavior of the Domain Access module.

Under Domain Strict, only authenticated users (those who have registered)
are given any domain-specific privileges.

Anonymous users will only be able to view content that is assigned to "all
affiliates."

As a result, enabling this module may cause content to disappear from your
site for users who are not logged in.  This is by design.

Refer to domain > domain_strict > README.txt

----
7.  Uninstalling

When you disable this module, it will reset your {node_access} tables and
remove all records from the {domain_access} table.  This will remove all
access rules associated with this module.

You may then uninstall the module normally.

You should also revert the patches that you applied and remove
any extra code from your settings.php file.

To revert a patch, see http://drupal.org/patch/reverse
