FeedAPI Comments
----------------

Requirements:
 * FeedAPI (http://drupal.org/project/feedapi)
 * PHP5 (SimpleXML)
 * Drupal 6

Package content:

 - Parser Comments module for scraping comments from sites directly.

 - FeedAPI Comments for generating Drupal comments from feed items.
   You can alternatively use FeedAPI's node processor which allows you to
   create nodes from remote comments.

Installation:
 - Create a new content-type and enable FeedAPI, enable and configure 
   comment parser, enable and configure comment processor or alternatively
   the node processor. 
   
Usage:
 - Supply the URL of the post with comments. For example:

 - Refresh the feed node and it will be commented with the comments from
   the source site (if you use the FeedAPI Comments processor).
