Description
------------

Syndication.module offers a web page which centralizes all of the RSS feeds
generated by Drupal. This helps users find interesting feeds from your web site.

Currently, the syndication page helps visitors find the following feeds:
- the blog feed of any user or all users
- node feeds for taxonomy terms
- a directory of all feeds being consumed by the aggregator.module
- atom feeds from the front page and users blogs (if the atom module is installed)
- feeds produced by the views module

Also, modules may insert their own boxes onto this page using hook_syndication. See Help for details

Feel free to improve this module and upload patches.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the syndication.module to the Drupal modules directory. Drupal should
automatically detect it. Then enable the module in Admin -> Site Configuration -> Modules

2. Browse to Admin -> Blocks and enable the Syndication (more) block. You'll also want
to disable the plain Syndication block offerred by node.module.

3. Visit the admin/content/syndication page and choose which feeds you would like to show on the page

To see your new Syndication page, follow the 'more' link which appears in the Block, or browse to q=syndication.
