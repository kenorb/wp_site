This module makes it possible to import and export vocabularies and 
taxonomy terms via XML. It requires taxonomy.module.

== Exporting vocabularies ==

Once installed and enabled, this module provides a list of downloadable 
XML documents for each vocabulary at admin/taxonomy/export. 

== Importing a vocabulary ==

To import a vocabulary, use admin/taxonomy/import.

The file "sample.xml" is a sample XML-formatted vocabulary that can 
be used for testing purposes. It contains a vocabulary named "Editorial 
sections" that contains four terms: "Analysis," "Feature," "News" and 
"Opinion." Using the options available from admin/taxonomy/import, you
can either add those terms to an existing vocabulary, or create a new
"Editorial sections" vocabulary on your site.
