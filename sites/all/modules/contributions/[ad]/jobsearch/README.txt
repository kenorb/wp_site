Description
-----------
This module provides your sites visitors to browse and search jobs, or post their
resumes for employers/recruiters to see. It also allows job seekers to apply for
jobs. In effect, your site can be a mini monster.com or hotjobs.com.

It can be setup for one single firm (e.g. a recruiting company), or as a general
job site (e.g. like monster.com).

Jobs and resumes (CVs) are two different types of content. They can be a simple
type (no extra fields) or you can use CCK to create more sophisticated content
types (e.g. you can add whether the job is a full time or part time, permanent
or contract, years of experience, ...etc.).

Resumes can also have attachments (e.g. resume in Word or PDF format).

Of course, jobs can be assigned various categories, such as jobs by location,
jobs by industry, ...etc.

Recruiters can view all jobs in the system.

Site visitors can browse jobs, either by date, or by category (as set above),
or with anything that views can do.

Visitors can register on the site, and then are allowed to post resumes, and
apply for jobs. Using extra modules, you can setup the site so that recruiters/
employers would have to pay to post jobs on the site. You can do the same for
job seekers if you so wish.

When someone applies for a job, they can select from resumes they have created.
If they do not have resumes, they will be prompted to create one.  Once they apply,
and email is sent to the person who posted the job, with a link to the resume, and
the user's profile. The resume will also be placed in a queue for review.

Optionally, resumes are kept private and only a recruiter or the author can see
it. Other job seekers cannot view other people's resumes.

Search functions allow users who can view resumes to search them, and the same
applies to jobs as well.

Expanded usage with other modules
---------------------------------
Using the views module, as well as CCK, you can present the jobs in various ways
to the users, with drop down selectable lists.

You can also use the location module to setup proximity searches for jobs by zip
code, city, or jobs within 25 miles of zip code 90210.

If you want job postings and/or resumes to expire after a preset period, you can
use the scheduler module to do that.

Also, if you want users to pay for posting jobs or resumes, you can use userpoints
with ecommmerce integration, and userpoints node limit.

You can use Ecommerce with EC Role module so users can buy the employer/recruiter
role so they are able to post jobs. Similarly, you can setup job seeker as a 
role, and users can post their resumes and apply for jobs if they buy that role.
