It is possible to override adserve settings by adding them to the $conf array
in settings.php.  Read more about how to override a variable in the comments
within settings.php.

Any adserve variable can be overridden in this way.

What follows is a sample overidden settings.php conf array, including some
non-adserve variables along with adserve variables:

------------

conf = array(
  'site_name' => 'My Drupal site',
  'theme_default' => 'minelli',
  'anonymous' => 'Visitor',
  'adcache' => 'none',
  'method' => 'javascript',
);
