Installation:
-------------
1) Download, compile and install the latest MaxMind GeoIP C library.  (The URL
   can be found above in the requirements section.)

   Debian/Ubuntu users can easily install the GeoIP C library without compiling
   it using the following command:
     sudo aptitude install libgeoip-dev libgeoip1


2) Download and install the latest geoip PHP PECL package.  (The URL can be
   found above in the requirements section.)  Directions on how to install
   and configure the geoip package can be found here:
     http://www.php.net/manual/en/geoip.setup.php

   It is generally as simple as typing the following command, then adding 
   "extension=geoip.so" to your php.ini:
     sudo pecl install geoip

   Once installed, restart Apache and review the output from phpinfo() to 
   verify the geoip is properly installed.


3) Download and install one or more of the MaxMind GeoIP binary databases.  You
   can install one of the free databases, or one of the commercial databases.
   (URLs can be found above in the requirements sections.)  Installation
   instructions can be found here:
     http://www.maxmind.com/app/installation


4) Enable the ad_geoip module.

   Visit "Administer >> Site building >> Modules" and enable the "Ad GeoIP"
   module, found in the "Ad" section toward the top of that patch.  You can
   then visit "Administer >> Logs >> Status report" to confirm that the GeoIP
   requirements are properly installed.
