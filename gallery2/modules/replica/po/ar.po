"A replica is an item that shares the original data file with another item, to save disk "
"space. In all other respects it is a separate item, with its own captions, thumbnail, "
"resizes, comments, etc. Captions are initially copied from the source item but may be "
"changed. Either the replica or the source may be moved or deleted without affecting the "
"other."
